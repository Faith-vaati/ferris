<!-- The transform-origin property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is applied. For example, when performing a rotate (which you will do later in this project), the transform-origin determines around which point the element is rotated.




The @keyframes at-rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation. Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points in the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define the start and end of the sequence.

The animation-iteration-count property sets how many times your animation should repeat. This can be set to a number, or to infinite to indefinitely repeat the animation. Your Ferris wheel should never stop, so set the .wheel selector to have an animation-iteration-count of infinite -->
